# Project 2- News site.

The projekt was to bild a news site and using flexbox for the layout. The site was also to be responsive for different devices, such as mobile, tablet and desktop. 

## The problem
The biggest problem was to figure out how the "box in a box in a box" (ie flexbox) works and how to place the news where I wanted in the different divices.

If I had more time I would have put my own text instead of "lorem", added more styling to the the news text and pictures. Added a email-form for contact. Mabye changed the headline to a picture instead. Changed the font-size for the different devices, 

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
